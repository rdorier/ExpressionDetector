# Expression Detector
This repository contains source code for a facial expression recognition application. There are three modes available :
- a simple display of camera output.
- Face detection : draw a rectangle on areas containing faces.
- Expression detection (currently not implemented) : draw a rectangle on areas containing faces and display the expression read on faces.

## Prerequisites
